# What is a Bat Mitzvah?

A FAQ for what to expect at the Saturday morning service.

- **What's a Bat Mitzvah?**<BR/>
TBD

- **I'm not Jewish, do I need to come to the Saturday morning service at Oak Park Temple?**<BR/>
Yes, we very much hope that you will come to the service. The service is where Pauline performs with the support of her family and friends. It is important that you be there with her to celebrate this milestone that she has worked so hard to achieve. 

- **Will I feel welcome at Oak Park Temple?**<BR/>
Yes! We belong to this temple because the clergy and congregation are very warm and welcoming to **everyone**. Oak Park Temple is part of the Reform Movement, which is on the liberal end of the spectrum in nearly every sense. The rabbi and congregation have strong ties to congregations from many churches and mosques in the Chicago area. See [here](http://abc7chicago.com/religion/building-bridges-between-muslim-jewish-communities-in-oak-park/1670287/) and [here](http://www.oakpark.com/Community/Blogs/11-14-2017/Out-of-many-faiths,-one-service/) for examples. Do not hesitate to contact us with any questions. We can also put you in touch with Rabbi Weiss who will be more than happy to talk to you about any concerns.

- **If I stand up at a particular time, follow along to a certain prayer or song, or wear a kippah, am I at risk of changing my religion?**<BR/>
No. Converting to Judaism involves a long process of study and many meetings with a rabbi. It is not possible to become jewish inadvertently or instantly. There will be times in the service (see above) when everyone will stand; this is out of respect and does not constitute any affirmation of religious belief. We hope you will feel comfortable standing with us. Similarly, wearing a kippah is also done out of respect. 

- **I may need to step out of the sanctuary. How can I do that?**<BR/>
If you need to step out into the lobby, please do so quietly and come back in when you are able. You should try not to step out if the congregation is standing. The time of least disruption is when the congregation has been standing and transitions to sitting - simply step out then. If you can't wait for an opportune time, then just don't worry about it and go into the lobby quietly. There's a bathroom in the lobby as well as more bathrooms at the top and bottom of the stairs that are by the main entrance. If you are in need of assistance, there will be someone in the temple office who can help you. 

- **I can't make the service, can I still come to the party?**<BR/>
As mentioned above, we very much hope that you will join us to support Pauline and see her reach the milestone that she has worked so hard to achieve. But if missing the service is unavoidable, then we would be very happy for you to join the celebration at the party in Countryside.
