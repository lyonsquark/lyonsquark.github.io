### When should I arrive Saturday morning at Oak Park Temple?

Please arrive or drop off your child at Oak Park Temple no later than 9:45am. Note that this weekend is the Chicago Air and Water show. There will be about a million people (really!) at the Chicago lakefront each day for the show, so tollway/expressway traffic may be heavier than for a usual Saturday morning. With no traffic, it takes us 30 minutes to drive from our house in Willowbrook to Oak Park Temple. That travel time doubles in heavy traffic. A phone app with accurate traffic information, like Waze, is very helpful. Check your arrival time well in advance to see if you have to leave earlier than you anticipated. That being said, if you end up arriving late then enter the sanctuary and find a seat quietly. We'll be glad that you made it. 

Driving from Oak Park Temple to Capri Banquets & Catering in Countryside should take about 20-30 minutes. 

Note that I may send out an e-mail to those who are coming from particular areas (e.g. near Fermilab; near Cass Jr. High) to facilitate car pooling. If you'd rather I not include you, then let me know before August 1. 

### Drop off and pick up information

<B>Note that drop off and pick up are in different towns!</B> Please drop off your child at Oak Park Temple (1235 Harlem Ave, Oak Park) no later than 9:45am Saturday morning. <span style="color:red">To make things easier, we can drive unaccompanied children from services at Oak Park to the luncheon/party in Countryside with their parent’s permission.</span> If you would prefer to drive your own child between the venues, please pick up your child at 12:15pm at Oak Park Temple and drive them to Capri Banquets & Catering (6240 Joliet Road, Countryside). When the party is over, please pick up your child at Capri Banquets & Catering in Countryside <b>no later than 5pm</b>. Note that I may send out an e-mail to those who are coming from particular areas (e.g. near Fermilab; near Cass Jr. High) to facilitate car-pooling. If you’d rather I not include you, then let me know before August 1.


### Will I be fed?

YES! Directly after the Saturday morning service at the temple vegetarian and dairy appetizers and snacks as well as non-alcoholic drinks will be provided. Following that there will be a full Italian luncheon buffet and a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks at the banquet hall. (The caterer owns the excellent Capri Restaurant (Italian food) in Burr Ridge). We promise you will not go hungry!

Please let us know ahead of time if you have any dietary restrictions. Good vegetarian options will be available. 

### What will be at the party?

Food and fun! A DJ will be spinning the tunes for fun and dancing. The hall is very large with an area outdoors, so chatting should be easy if you are not dancing.
