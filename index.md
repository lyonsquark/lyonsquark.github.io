### When should I arrive Saturday morning at Oak Park Temple?

Please arrive or drop off your child at Oak Park Temple a little before 10am. Note that this weekend is the Chicago Air and Water show. There will be about a million people (really!) at the Chicago lakefront each day for the show, so tollway/expressway traffic may be heavier than for a usual Saturday morning. With no traffic, it takes us 30 minutes to drive from our house in Willowbrook to Oak Park Temple. That travel time doubles in heavy traffic. A phone app with accurate traffic information, like Waze, is very helpful. Check your arrival time well in advance to see if you have to leave earlier than you anticipated. That being said, if you end up arriving late then enter the sanctuary and find a seat quietly. We'll be glad that you made it. 

Driving from Oak Park Temple to Capri Banquets & Catering in Countryside should take about 20-30 minutes. 

### What if I'm dropping off/picking up my child?

Please drop off your child at Oak Park Temple a little before 10am Saturday morning. We will provide transportation from services at Oak Park to the luncheon/party in Countryside. Please pick up your child at **Capri Banquets & Catering** in Countryside (address above) no later than 5pm. 

### Will I be fed?

YES! Directly after the Saturday morning service small sandwiches and other finger food will be served at the temple to keep you sustained as you drive from Oak Park to Countryside (or if you are a kid without your parents, ride the bus we are providing). The luncheon will start soon after everyone arrives at the banquet hall. The caterer is from the excellent Capri Restaurant (Italian food) in Burr Ridge. We promise you will not go hungry! 

Please let us know ahead of time if you have any dietary restrictions.

### What will be at the party?

Food and fun! A DJ will be spinning the tunes for fun and dancing. The hall is very large with an area outdoors, so chatting should be easy if you are not dancing.
