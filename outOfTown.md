# Information for Out of Town Guests

> We're so glad you are making the trip to Chicago for Pauline's Bat Mitzvah. Here's some information.


### When should I arrive?
We are hosting a dinner at Oak Park Temple for you and other out of town guests before Friday night services on 8/17 at 6:30pm (time may change). It would be great if you could attend. If you need to arrive later on Friday, then note that Friday night services begin at 8pm and the Bat Mitzvah service begins at 10am on Saturday.

### Hotel room blocks
We have arranged for room blocks at two hotels at significant savings over regular rates. **You must reserve before July 19 to receive the block rates.** Rates below do not include taxes.

### Is it better to fly into Midway or O'Hare?
If you are flying SouthWest Airlines you will fly in/out of Midway. All other airlines fly in/out of O'Hare. If you have a choice of airlines, then in general Midway is the better choice. Midway is smaller and easier to navigate than O'Hare, and Midway tends to be more robust (e.g. fewer cancellations/delays) if there is bad weather. That being said, O'Hare isn't that much more difficult. They are both about the same distance from our house. The hotels are a bit closer to Midway.

### Will I need to rent a car?
Likely yes. We will not have extra room in our cars to transport others. Traveling solely by Uber/Lyft will probably be expensive. In general, it's difficult to get around the Chicago Suburbs without a car. It is also very helpful to have a navigation/real-time traffic app like Waze on your phone.

### Do I have to pay tolls?
The Illinois Tollway is a fact of life here. If you are arriving at Midway you can get to the hotel without tolls. If arriving at O'Hare, you will have several tolls you cannot easily avoid. You can get to and from the synagogue and banquet hall without tolls. All rental cars should be equipped with an IPass toll transponder that will allow you to use the IPass lanes/gateways. That being said, once you use the transponder for the fist time, you will typically be charged a large daily rate for the rest of your rental (even if you don't use it again) on top of the tolls that you incur. You may be able to avoid this by deactivating the transponder (if possible, ask at the rental desk) and going through the cash lanes. You can also go through the IPass lanes anyway. You have 7 days to pay the tolls online before the charges turn into  violations (you'll be assessed a fine and the rental car company will tack on more fees to that - so don't miss the 7 day window). See https://www.illinoistollway.com/tolling-information/unpaid-tolls . You will need to remember the routes that you took to select the tolls that you missed. It's somewhat complicated, but you can save a significant amount of money this way if you do it right. 

All tollways are marked as such. I-55 (Stevenson Expressway) and I-290 (Eisenhower Expressway) have no tolls. All other expressways (I-88/Regan, I-294/Tri-State, I-355/Veterans) are tollways.

### I want to eat something that I can't get at home
