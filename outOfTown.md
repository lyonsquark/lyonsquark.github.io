# Information for Out of Town Guests

We're so glad you are making the trip to Chicago for Pauline's Bat Mitzvah. Here's some information.

### When should I arrive?
We are hosting a dinner at Oak Park Temple for you and other out of town guests before Friday night services on 8/17 at 6:30pm. It would be great if you could attend. If you need to arrive later on Friday, then note that Friday night services begin at 8pm and the Bat Mitzvah service begins at 10am on Saturday.

### Where should I stay (room blocks)?
We have arranged for room blocks at two hotels at significant savings over regular rates. **You must reserve before July 19 to receive the block rates.** Rates below do not include taxes.

  - Best Western Plus, [web](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-countryside/best-western-plus-chicagoland-countryside/propertyCode.14182.html), 6251 Joliet Road Countryside, Illinois 60525, (708) 354-5200. Use code "Lyon Bat-Mitzvah". $99/night and includes continental breakfast. There is no swimming pool. This hotel is across the street from the banquet hall. It is about 15 minutes from our house. It is close to La Grange road with many restaurant options. 

  - Crowne Plaza, [web](https://www.cpchicagosw.com), 300 South Frontage Road, Burr Ridge, IL 60527, (630) 325-2900. Use code "???". $119/night and includes a breakfast buffet at the restaurant. This hotel was recently renovated. It has a very nice swimming pool (Pauline took lessons there before the renovation). It also has a restaurant and bar. It is less than 10 minutes away from the banquet hall and less than 10 minutes from our house. It is close to the Burr Ridge Village Center with many nice dining options. 

### Is it better to fly into Midway or O'Hare?
If you are flying SouthWest Airlines you will fly in/out of Midway. All other airlines fly in/out of O'Hare. If you have a choice of airlines, then in general Midway is the better choice. Midway is smaller and easier to navigate than O'Hare, and Midway tends to be more robust (e.g. fewer cancellations/delays) if there is bad weather. That being said, O'Hare isn't that much more difficult. They are both about the same distance from our house and the hotels (see below). 

### Will I need to rent a car?
Likely yes. We will not have extra room in our cars to transport others. Traveling solely by Uber/Lyft will probably be expensive. In general, it's difficult to get around the Chicago Suburbs without a car. It is very helpful to have a navigation/real-time traffic app like Waze on your phone. 

### Do I have to pay tolls?
The Illinois Tollway is a fact of life here. If you are arriving at Midway you can get to the hotel without tolls. If arriving at O'Hare, you will have several tolls you cannot easily avoid. All rental cars should be equipped with an IPass toll transponder that will allow you to use the IPass lanes/gateways. That being said, once you use the transponder for the fist time, you will typically be charged a large daily rate for the rest of your rental (even if you don't use it again) on top of the tolls that you incur. You may be able to avoid this by deactivating the transponder (if possible, ask at the rental desk) and going through the IPass lanes anyway. You have 7 days to pay the tolls online before the charges turn into  violations (you'll be assessed a fine and the rental car company will tack on more fees to that - so don't miss the 7 day window). See https://www.illinoistollway.com/tolling-information/unpaid-tolls . You will need to remember the routes that you took to select the tolls that you missed. It's somewhat complicated, but you can save a significant amount of money this way if you do it right.

### I want to eat someting that I can't get at home
We have several favorite ethnic dining options that you may want to try Thursday night and/or if you are staying Sunday.

  - Taste of India, 7243 Kingery Hwy (Route 83), Willowbrook, IL 60527, (630) 323-1333. The best Indian food around. Great buffet on weekends. 
  - Chinese Kitchen, 6551 S Cass Ave, Westmont, IL 60559, (630) 968-3828. Has become our favorite Chinese restaurant. Be sure to ask for the "other" menu with more authentic, unusual, and terrific dishes (it's in English).
  - Taste Indian Chinese Cuisine,  2117 63rd St, Downers Grove, IL 60516, (630) 541-9872. Unusual and super-spicy (but delicious) dishes. Too spicy for Pauline, but we love it. 
  - New Korea Garden, 204 N Cass Ave, Westmont, IL 60559, (630) 852-1900. Great Korean dishes and BBQ. We've been going here since before Pauline was born. A top favorite. 
  - Cida Thai, 5435 South La Grange Road, Countryside, IL 60525, (708) 482-0706. Awesome Thai food. Be sure to get the chicken soup.
  - Bohemian Crystal, [web](http://www.bohemiancrystal.net), 639 Blackhawk Dr, Westmont, IL 60559, (630) 789-1981. Hearty Eastern European cuisine. A fun place.
  - Sawa's Old Warsaw Restaurant, 9200 W Cermak Rd, Broadview, IL 60155, (708) 343-9040. A little farther than the others (about 20 minutes). Terrific Polish Smorgasbord. Very authentic and fun.
